# Hi!

I'm Ian, I'm from Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª

I make stuff, I code and I do maths!

I also make [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWigmcpi0rkFe0nwMOFwRg) about the stuff I make.

Day to day I'm a software engineer for [@KitmanLabs](https://github.com/KitmanLabs)

You can follow the things I work on [here](https://iancarey.ie/blog)
